# LessonsToPayment
Come join me as I explore more about the Payments Industry and how it works. I'll be covering 1 topic every day until I run out of things to talk about. 


### Day 1 (Learning about ISO8583)
Today is Day 1 of the entire learning journey, as a start we will be exploring more about ISO8583 and what it actually is. ISO stands for the International Organisation for Standardisation, think of it as a non-governmental organisation that develops and publishes standards that apply globally. It can be for products, services and system. This way everyone who adheres to it knows that there is a certain benchmark to follow in terms of consistency, safety, reliability and quality across broders and industries. 

Note: ISO can apply for a lot of things from Cars (ISO 9001) to Food and Beverage Products (ISO 14001) and Medical Device (ISO 13485).

But in this case we are referring to ISO 8583 which is looking at the payments industry. 

A bit more about the history for ISO 8583, it was used to unite the different payment systems at that point in time. **ISO 8583 standards for the International Standard for Financial Transaction Card Originated Interchange Messaging.** This was important as it helped to define message format and even Communication Flows. 

It has undergone 3 different iterations:
1987: 
  (a) - Defined Message Type Indicators (MTI) --> Important, we will cover this another day
  (b) - Bitmaps & Data Elements
  (c) - 128 Data Elements
1993:
  (a) - Refinements & Clarifications
  (b) - Flexibility for new Card Processing Services
  (c) - New Data Elements and Mesasge Types
  (d) - Improved support for multi-currency, addressed inconsistencies and even extended the number of available fields
2003:
  (a) - XML Representation (against traditional Bitmap format)
  (b) - Better definitions for Data Elements (Beyond 128 Data Elements)
  (c) - Better Support for International Use (Multi-Currency, different card systems)
2023:
  (a) - Consolidated Previous Releases and technical revisions.
  (b) - Restructured the standard for easier maintenance
  (c) - Greater interoperability between new digital payment systems while maintaining backwards compatibility.

  There are also newer ISO in the card payments industry! 
New ISO Technology: **_ISO 20022_**
